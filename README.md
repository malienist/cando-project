# All things Threat-intelligence and OSINT

## This repo has all my code that helps gather OSINT and use it 

# Shodan.io 
You can use these scripts to download IOCs from the Malware Hunter feature offered by Shodan and Recorded Future. You need a private API key to access this feature and the IOCs can be downloaded and stored as CSVs. 

# ThreatConnect
These scripts help injest the data in a useable format into your ThreatConnect instance. Once in there, this data can then be used for triage or integrated with Splunk (SIEM) to generate alerts.
